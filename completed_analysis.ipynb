    "Now that our tools are in place we can load the data. To do so we will use a **function** built into Pandas. It's easiest to think of functions as tools that conduct a task. These tools can take different **arguments**, which are variables that help functions complete their tasks. In this case we will use Pandas' `read_csv` function. In its simplest form, the function takes one argument - the path to the file we want to open.\n",

Since our spreadsheet data mostly consists of categories (e.g. the race of a driver) rather than numbers (e.g. the driver was going 53 mph) we are going to tell Pandas to import everything in the spreadsheet as if it was just text using the `dtype=object` argument. This has the added benefit of suppressing a warning issued by Pandas because it cannot determine the data types for each column.\n",

It may be important to keep track of how many records do not have actual data in it for a given column.

Luckily, Pandas has a handy function to do that."

The first function is just starting up a chart and telling it what data we want to use. Then we tell it what type of chart we want (a line or fever chart in this case). Lastly we tell it what columns in our data should be used for the chart axes. "

    "Now we can start playing with demographic data that we have in the data set. Our initial look at the data showed us that there isn't any information on the age of the driver, but we do have pretty good data on gender and race/ethnicity. Rather than examining both gender and race separately, let's see if we can do an analysis on both columns at the same time.\n",

    "To do this we will use what is called a pivot table. Those of you who have worked with Excel may be familiar with pivot tables. They are a way to restructure your data to provide a different perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started though, let's do some housekeeping. The `driver_gender` column identifies gender by abbreviation. Let's change that to a full spelling. Earlier, we used `rename` to change the column name, but now we're changing the data, not the column name. So we'll use the `replace` function."

This sort of information is usually requested from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles.\n",

This means drivers stopped by the DPS are more likely to be from outside the state – or given the proximity to the border – from Mexico. So population figures from a secondary source would not necessarily represent the population on the road.\n",

For our purposes there are three different types of searches – probable cause, warrant and consent searches. The ones we want to focus on are consent searches. This type of search does not require a search warrant, and the officer most likely does not have probable cause. As such this search is completely up to the officer's discretion.\n",
